This is a command based TODO list program written in python.
Why one more TODO program?
    As a practice on using the command based dispatcher.
    Although this is in python, I guess that in C++ would be similar.
    I would like to add all kinds of functionality to it.

TODO list program :
Functionalities needed :
(DONE)#Function to add task : A task is a list that has a unique index,
a task string, due date, importance and tag(s) attached to it.
(DONE)#Function to get a list , imports a todo-list from a file and saves : list should be comma seperated, one task on a line in the file
(DONE)#Function to save list to file : save "filename" saves the list. 'save' saves as default to "tasklist.txt"
(TODO)*1Function to modify a task, ,it's due date or importance or the string or tags
(TODO)*2Function to sort the task based on due date or importance or both
(TODO)*0Function to say that a task has been completed with the time of completion

The program is at todo.py
It is run using the command "python todo.py" from the terminal.
Uses the cmd module to recursively take input
